# football-tournament-simulation
AI-powered football tournament simulator using XGBoost
## Project Overview
This project simulates a **football tournament** using **AI-powered match predictions**. The model is trained on historical match data using **XGBoost**, with added randomness for realistic results.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Predictions** (Trained with 30,000+ historical matches)
- **Dynamic Match Simulation** (Controlled randomness for realism)
- **Group & Knockout Stages** (Follows real tournament rules)
- **Customizable Model & Thresholds**

## Data
- `matches.csv` → Historical match data (30,000+ matches)
- `teams.csv` → Team-to-confederation mapping
- `qualified.csv` → Teams that advanced to knockouts
- 'updated2.csv' -> transformed dataset ready for training
- 'sim.csv' -> Dataset for simulation of Tournament with all the features for every matchup
